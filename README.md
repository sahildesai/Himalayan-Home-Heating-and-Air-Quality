# Himalayan-Home-Heating-and-Air-Quality

The main aim of the project is to deal with the development of a coupled Heat and Air Quality dynamic model for Himalayan House based on the first principles of thermodynamics. The model uses a lumped parameter approach for representation of the room air temperature and air quality. Use of mass and energy balance equations is made for the development of the dynamic model which is solved in Simulink MATLAB environment. Only a theoretical approach is used for the development of the model. The model accounts for various factors such as insulations of the doors, roofs, floor, windows, etc. ventilation rates in and out of the house and the amount of solar radiation falling on the house. The results for the model are plotted as variation of temperature vs time and the air quality in terms of PM, Carbon dioxide and Carbon monoxide concentrations in the house. The model will also provide control over the operation of cook stove.
